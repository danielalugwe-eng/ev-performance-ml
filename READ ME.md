Electric Vehicle Performance Analysis (Machine Learning)

This project explores the factors that influence the performance and efficiency of electric vehicles. The goal was to analyze real-world EV data, clean and prepare it, build predictive models, and uncover insights that can help improve EV design and usage.

The work covers data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and interpretation. Several machine learning techniques were tested to understand which variables best predict EV performance.

What’s Inside
	•	Data used for training and testing
	•	Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step analysis
	•	Machine learning models and performance summaries
	•	Visualizations showing trends and important patterns
	•	Final report with insights and recommendations

Key Outcomes
	•	Identified the most important features that affect electric vehicle performance
	•	Built a predictive model capable of estimating efficiency from EV characteristics
	•	Highlighted patterns that can guide manufacturers and engineers in improving energy use
